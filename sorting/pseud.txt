1 − Choose the highest index value has pivot
2 − Take two variables to point left 
            and right of the list excluding pivot
3 − left points to the low index
4 − right points to the high
5 − while value at left is less than pivot move right
6 − while value at right is greater than pivot move left
7 − if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right
8 − if left ≥ right, the point where they met is new pivot
